<p align="center">An Android application for tracking the growth of your orchids, making care easier and collecting information about orchids in general.</p>
<p align="center">A big project I am always working on, whenever I have time. I hope I can publish a first release soon.</p>

## üß∞ Tools and technologies being used
- [**Architecture**][0] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [Data Binding][1] - This support library allows you to bind your layouts' UI components to data sources in your app without the need for any Java/Kotlin code.
  - [Lifecycles][2] - Create a UI with components that automatically respond to lifecycle events such as creation of a fragment.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - An observable and lifecycle-aware data holder class.
  - [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - In-app navigation made easy. Also complex navigation information can be put in a central and visualized place with the Navigation graph.
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Abstraction layer over SQLite also providing benefits like compile-time verification of SQL queries.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. It also allows data to survive configuration changes and easy scheduling of asynchronous tasks.
  - [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanagerf b) - Handling persistent work across all Android API versions with a single uniform API.
- **Miscellaneous and third party libraries**
  - [Coil][9] for image loading backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
  - [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/) and [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for [DI](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection).
  - [Kotlin Coroutines][10] and [Flow][11] for managing asynchronous programming and stream processing.
